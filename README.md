A stock market analysis project developed using R Shiny is a sophisticated and interactive web application designed to empower users in their exploration, visualization, and in-depth analysis of financial market data. This projectâ€™s primary objective is to provide a user-friendly platform that caters to both novice and experienced investors, enabling them to make wellinformed investment decisions. The application connects to data sources such as Yahoo Finance to fetch real-time or historical stock market data and presents it to users in an intuitive and interactive manner. Key features include the ability to customize the analysis by selecting specific stocks, defining time periods, and choosing from a wide range of financial indicators.
here we use a 'stock_market.csv' which contains Name,Sector,Ticker,Country also. 
The whole data and related things is used for an educational purpose to improve skillset of the user.we don't claim authority on this rather than #my skill.
